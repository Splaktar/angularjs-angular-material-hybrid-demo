# AngularJS/Angular Material Hybrid Demo

This was started on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angularjs-material-ngupgradelite-demo),
based on a demo by [George Kalpakas](https://github.com/gkalpak), but using ngUpgrade can be done
in a way that is either compatible with StackBlitz or the Angular CLI, not both.

## AngularJS Material Migration Guide

We recently published a [comprehensive guide](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/migration)
for upgrading AngularJS Material apps to Angular. It includes guidance for migrating to
Angular Material, the Angular Component Dev Kit (CDK), and the Angular Flex Layout library.
Additionally, we provide guidance on using pure CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, migration of
theming features, services, typography, and more.
